<h2>Transactions</h2>
Each transaction has one owner (the one who sends the money) and many recipients<br>
Transaction rules:
- Let's suppose a sender wants to send money to many recipients. Then a list of the coin
transfers is made. The list of coin transfers will start executing untill a coin transfer is
found that surpasses the sender account total. <b>This functionality may change, depending on 
the needs.</b>
